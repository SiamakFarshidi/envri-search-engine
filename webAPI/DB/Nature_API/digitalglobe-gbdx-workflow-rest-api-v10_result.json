{"API name": ["DigitalGlobe GBDX Workflow REST API v1.0"], "Description": [" The DigitalGlobe GBDX Workflow system is a series of tasks chained together to run on the GBDX platform. Each \"task\" is an individual process that performs a specific action. In order to run as part of a workflow, a task must be registered in the workflow system's task registry. The Workflow API allows users to: register a task in the workflow system's task registry, manage tasks in the task registry, create a new workflow by submitting a workflow definition and more. GBDX is a living digital library that documents our planet with tools to extract meaningful insights at scale from that library. The ecosystem matches the creators of those insights with customers who can turn them into effective solutions. It is geospatial big data made accessible using a cloud-based platform that puts location intelligence at your fingertips. DigitalGlobe combines resolution, accuracy, global coverage and experience to provide high-resolution Earth satellite imagery, data and analysis."], "Url": ["https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/docs/workflow-api-course"], "Category": ["Images", "Analytics", "Big Data", "Cloud", "Extraction", "Intelligence", "Library", "Location", "Mapping", "Nature", "Tools"], "Provider": ["DigitalGlobe"], "ServiceType": ["Web/Internet"], "Documentation": ["https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["https://geobigdata.io/workflows/v1/"], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
