{"API name": ["DigitalGlobe GBDX S3 Storage REST API v1.0"], "Description": [" GBDX stores ancillary data and derived products in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket. When a workflow is run on the GBDX platform, a task called \"StageDataToS3\" is typically the last task run by the workflow. This task takes the processed data and places it in the AWS S3 bucket. The GBDX S3 Storage Service allows users to access this data and provides the temporary credentials required to access a Prefix, Folder, or Object in the S3 bucket. GBDX is a living digital library that documents our planet with tools to extract meaningful insights at scale from that library. The ecosystem matches the creators of those insights with customers who can turn them into effective solutions. It is geospatial big data made accessible using a cloud-based platform that puts location intelligence at your fingertips. DigitalGlobe combines resolution, accuracy, global coverage and experience to provide high-resolution Earth satellite imagery, data and analysis."], "Url": ["https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/docs/s3-storage-service-course"], "Category": ["Big Data", "Analytics", "Cloud", "Extraction", "Images", "Intelligence", "Library", "Location", "Mapping", "Nature", "Storage", "Tools"], "Provider": ["DigitalGlobe"], "ServiceType": ["Web/Internet"], "Documentation": ["https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["https://geobigdata.io/s3creds/v1/prefix"], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
