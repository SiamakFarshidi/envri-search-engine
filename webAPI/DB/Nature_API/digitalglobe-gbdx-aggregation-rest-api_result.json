{"API name": ["DigitalGlobe GBDX Aggregation REST API"], "Description": [" The DigitalGlobe GBDX Aggregation vector capability gives users the ability to summarize a vast amount of vector data rapidly and easily by location, keyword, date/time, and more. Aggregations allow users to poll larger areas for more information before narrowing down their searches to eventually reach the specific data they desire to download. Aggregations also give users the ability to run analytics such as change detection and discovering zones similar to an area of interest. GBDX is a living digital library that documents our planet with tools to extract meaningful insights at scale from that library. The ecosystem matches the creators of those insights with customers who can turn them into effective solutions. It is geospatial big data made accessible using a cloud-based platform that puts location intelligence at your fingertips. DigitalGlobe combines resolution, accuracy, global coverage and experience to provide high-resolution Earth satellite imagery, data and analysis."], "Url": ["https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/docs/aggregations-service-overview"], "Category": ["Big Data", "Analytics", "Cloud", "Extraction", "Images", "Intelligence", "Library", "Location", "Mapping", "Nature", "Tools"], "Provider": ["DigitalGlobe"], "ServiceType": ["Web/Internet"], "Documentation": ["https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": [" https://vector.geobigdata.io/insight-vector/api/aggregation"], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
