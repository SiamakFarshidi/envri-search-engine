{"API name": ["DigitalGlobe GBDX Write Vector REST API"], "Description": [" DigitalGlobe provides a service that allows users that have vectors of their own and would like to visualize in the index, easily pass them to other users. Vector write can be completed via shapefile ingest or API writes of JSON formatted vectors. JSON formatted vectors may be written via either synchronous and asynchronous methods, and users specify the index for their own provided vectors. Vector generation is useful for direct additions of or updates to vectors, without needing a third party service or a vector submission request form. GBDX is a living digital library that documents our planet with tools to extract meaningful insights at scale from that library. The ecosystem matches the creators of those insights with customers who can turn them into effective solutions. It is geospatial big data made accessible using a cloud-based platform that puts location intelligence at your fingertips. DigitalGlobe combines resolution, accuracy, global coverage and experience to provide high-resolution Earth imagery, data and analysis."], "Url": ["https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/docs/write-vector-services-overview"], "Category": ["Big Data", "Analytics", "Cloud", "Extraction", "Images", "Intelligence", "Library", "Location", "Mapping", "Nature", "Photos", "Tools"], "Provider": ["DigitalGlobe"], "ServiceType": ["Web/Internet"], "Documentation": ["https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["https://vector.geobigdata.io/insight-vector/api/vector/"], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
