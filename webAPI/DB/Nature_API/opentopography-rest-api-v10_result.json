{"API name": ["OpenTopography REST API v1.0"], "Description": [" The OpenTopography API facilitates access to high resolution Earth topography data.\nThis RESTful Web service for global raster data returns metadata catalogs, data management, processing, and analysis, and data space. The data was collected during the NASA Shuttle Endeavour Radar Topography Mission in February, 2000. Raster data is geospatial data based on a matrix of square areas.\nThis project is supported by the National Science Foundation. The OpenTopography facility is located in the San Diego Supercomputer Center, at the University of California in San Diego."], "Url": ["https://opentopography.org/developers#SRTM"], "Category": ["Nature", "Data", "Geology", "Mapping", "Science"], "Provider": ["Open Topography"], "ServiceType": ["Web/Internet"], "Documentation": ["https://opentopography.org/developers"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["https://portal.opentopography.org/otr/"], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
