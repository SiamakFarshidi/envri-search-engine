{"API name": ["DigitalGlobe GBDX IDAHO REST API v1.0"], "Description": [" The DigitalGlobe GBDX IDAHO service is a cloud-based, data storage format designed for high availability and real time access. IDAHO is an acronym for the IPE Data Architecture Highly-available Object-store that is a tile-based imagery format optimized for storage in cloud-based object stores. IDAHO images consist of two file types; tiles and metadata files. Converting large footprint satellite imagery into the IDAHO format provides imagery-manipulating algorithms, and tile-based access to the imagery that significantly reduces load time and compute time through parallel processing. GBDX is a living digital library that documents our planet with tools to extract meaningful insights at scale from that library. The ecosystem matches the creators of those insights with customers who can turn them into effective solutions. It is geospatial big data made accessible using a cloud-based platform that puts location intelligence at your fingertips. DigitalGlobe combines resolution, accuracy, global coverage and experience to provide high-resolution Earth imagery, data and analysis."], "Url": ["https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/docs/idaho-course"], "Category": ["Big Data", "Analytics", "Big Data", "Cloud", "Extraction", "Intelligence", "Library", "Location", "Mapping", "Nature", "Photos", "Tools"], "Provider": ["DigitalGlobe"], "ServiceType": ["Web/Internet"], "Documentation": ["https://gbdxdocs.digitalglobe.com/"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["https://idaho.geobigdata.io/v1"], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
