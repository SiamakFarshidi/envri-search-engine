{"API name": ["Flooderizer Flood Detection REST API v1.0"], "Description": [" Flooderizer Flood Detection API detects flooded areas in an input photo using artificial intelligence and a powerful cloud infrastructure. Useful for IT developers who want to make apps for surveillance cameras or any kind of camera used at malls, buildings, roads, agriculture etc.\nFrom the provider: \"Flood Detection API - Flooderizer (also known as Flood Recognition API or Flood Detector API) is a cross browsers REST API which get a JSON input with a still photo (as base64 encoded string), containing flooded areas and returns a JSON string which contains predictions of the input photo regarding the probability of a flood. The recognized Flooded Areas have confidence score, timestamp, tagId, tagName. Of course, there are some limitations in order to get a higher accuracy. We recommend properly exposed, unobstructed JPEG photos at 1920x1080 (full HD resolution) where the flooded area is clear and focused. If the flooded area details are too small or blured, the accuracy is lower and the AI algorithm may not classify in a proper way. We do not store pictures. Also, the quality and the angles of the camera are very important and it contribute to a higher reading accuracy. It should has varifocal lenses, high shutter speed, good infrared lighting beam, full HD resolution.\nAllthough this Automatic Flood Detection API (currently we do not offer a Flood Detection sdk) is intended for software development and therefore developers, we have also here an Flood Detection online application that may be used to check the input and output JSONs of the API. The necessary steps are written below, basically for this real time Flood Detection API you send an authorized POST request in JSON format to the API endpoint and you get as JSON response the output as described below through parameters and examples.\nThis Flood Detection API is useful for a large number of domains like apps for: security cameras for malls, parkings, buildings, agriculture etc. You own the commercial copyright of the resulted JSON with no additional fee meaning you may use it in your own apps for sale.\""], "Url": ["https://www.de-vis-software.ro/flood-detection-api.aspx"], "Category": ["Artificial Intelligence", "Nature", "Recognition", "Water"], "Provider": ["DE VIS Software"], "ServiceType": ["Web/Internet"], "Documentation": ["https://www.de-vis-software.ro/flood-detection-api.aspx"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["https://www.de-vis-software.ro/flooderizer.aspx"], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
