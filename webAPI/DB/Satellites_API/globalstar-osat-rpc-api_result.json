{"API name": ["Globalstar OSAT RPC API"], "Description": [" The service provides an aid to scheduling satellite telephone calls. Its resources are specific to users of the provider's satellite phone hardware and intended to help these users identify windows of available bandwidth based on the locations from which they will be placing calls. Programmatic access provides the same functions available in the provider's interactive interface.\nAPI methods support programmatic access to schedules of access timing for satellite telephone communications. Methods allow designation of a terrestrial location by latitude and longitude along with a desired time period to make calls. Returned data provide periods of projected minimal competing traffic, supporting decision making about call scheduling."], "Url": ["https://srt.glpconnect.com:2044/osat/osat_api_docs/osat_api_services.html"], "Category": ["Telephony", "Satellites", "Scheduling"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": [], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": [], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
