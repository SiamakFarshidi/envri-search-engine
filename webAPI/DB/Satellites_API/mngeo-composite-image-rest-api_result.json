{"API name": ["MnGeo Composite Image REST API"], "Description": [" The service provides aerial and satellite photos depicting terrain within the U.S. state of Minnesota. It works through a single access point that automatically provides appropriate photos taken from aircraft or by earth-orbiting satellites, depending on the space covered in the request and the resolution or level of detail requested. Images are available for locations across the state, with emphasis on the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Some images are available of terrain bordering Minnesota, especially counties in Wisconsin near the Twin Cities. Images are used, for example, in the Interactive Twin Cities Transit Map from Metro Transit.\nAPI methods support access to imagery from the 7-country Twin Cities metro area and 4 counties to its north, 37 counties across Minnesota and near its eastern border, and areas within Canada along the state's northern border. Resolutions vary from 1:10,000 aerial photographs to FSA NAIP satellite photos up to 1:250,000 to even larger scale Landsat photos."], "Url": ["http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/wms/composite_image.html"], "Category": ["Photos", "Mapping", "Satellites"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["http://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/wms/composite_image.html"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["http://geoint.lmic.state.mn.us/cgi-bin/mncomp?"], "Support SSL": ["No"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
