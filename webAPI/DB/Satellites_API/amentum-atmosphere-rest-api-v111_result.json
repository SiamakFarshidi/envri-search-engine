{"API name": ["Amentum Atmosphere REST API v1.1.1"], "Description": [" Instantly access empirical models of atmospheric density and composition that are recommended by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) for satellite drag calculations.\nAPI requests must contain a key \"API-Key\" in the header (see code samples). Obtain a key from https://developer.amentum.io\nThe NRLMSISE-00 model was developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory. It is based on mass spectrometry and incoherent radar scatter data, includes drag and accelerometer data, and accounts for anomalous oxygen at high altitudes. It is recommended by the International Committee on Space Resarch (COSPAR) as the standard for atmospheric composition.\nThe API now automatically updates the Ap and F10.7 cm radio flux indices unless provided by the user.\nThe JB2008 (Jacchia-Bowman) model is a newer model developed by Space Environment Technologies and the US Air Force Space Command. The model accounts for various phenomena related to EUV heating of the thermosphere and uses the DST index as the driver of global density changes. The model is complementary to the NRLMSISE00 model and is more accurate during times of high solar activity and geomagnetic storms. It is recommended by COSPAR as the standard for thermospheric density in satellite drag calculations.\nThe API now automatically updates the indices needed to account for global density variations due to geomagnetic storms and EUV heating."], "Url": ["https://amentum.space/atmosphere"], "Category": ["Science", "Satellites", "Science"], "Provider": ["Amentum"], "ServiceType": ["Web/Internet"], "Documentation": ["https://atmosphere.amentum.space"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["https://atmosphere.amentum.io"], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
