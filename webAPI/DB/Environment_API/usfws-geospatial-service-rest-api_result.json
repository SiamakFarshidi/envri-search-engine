{"API name": ["USFWS Geospatial Service REST API"], "Description": [" The service from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provides geospatial data about U.S. wildlife habitats, including fisheries. It supports integration of data about animal populations and habitats from human observers and remote sensing networks with geographic information systems (GIS), including global positioning system (GPS) references.\nAPI methods support ArcGIS format for creating, updating, and distributing geospatial data collected during implementation of the USFWS Operational Plan. Methods give access to data about wildlife with GIS and GPS identifiers to allow mapping of observations and integration with other resource mapping applications. Datasets identify and allow mapping of coastal resources and wetlands, critical habitats inland, ecosystem regions, Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) and National Wildlife Refuges, migratory bird movements, and others."], "Url": ["http://www.fws.gov/gis/data/national/index.html"], "Category": ["Mapping", "Animals", "Environment", "Fishing", "Government", "USA"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": ["Web/Internet"], "Documentation": ["http://www.fws.gov/gis/data/national/index.html"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["http://ecos.fws.gov/tat_services/TessQuery?request=schema"], "Support SSL": ["No"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
