{"API name": ["SRTM RPC API"], "Description": [" The service provides a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) build from data representing terrain features as detected by the Shuttle Radar Tomography Mission (SRTM). Elevation affects the efficiency of solar energy collection, including photovoltaic (PV) electricity production. By modeling terrain features and elevation, the service helps to improve accuracy of estimates of solar energy production at a location.\nAPI methods support specification of an area of interest (AOI), either a bounding box defined by mapped coordinates or a single location. Methods return high-accuracy elevation data for use in solar energy production estimates."], "Url": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/w3c-web-services/srtm-w3c"], "Category": ["Weather", "Energy", "Environment", "Solar"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/w3c-web-services/srtm-w3c"], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": [], "Support SSL": [], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
