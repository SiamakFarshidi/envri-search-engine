{"API name": ["Environmental Life Cycle Impact Assessment RPC API"], "Description": [" The service from the Center for Energy and Processes (CEP) in France provides estimates of environmental impact of photovoltaic (PV) technologies over their complete life cycles. It assesses impact of PV solar electricity technologies and installations based on a number of established computation methods. Calculations of cost and benefit over the life of an installation help to guide decision-making and justify the investment.\nAPI methods support estimates of photovoltaic technology performance both at a geographic point on a map and within a defined area of interest (AOI). Life cycle cost and benefit are then estimated from the Ecoinvent database. Mapping data comply with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) protocol."], "Url": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/ogc-web-services/environmental-lca\u2026"], "Category": ["Weather", "Energy", "Environment"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/ogc-web-services/environmental-lca-ogc-wps"], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": [], "Support SSL": [], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
