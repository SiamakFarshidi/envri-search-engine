{"API name": ["Clean Power Estimator RPC API"], "Description": [" The service provides a tool for estimating cost savings and environmental benefits from renewable energy system installations. It is available both via a customizable web interface and a SOAP API. It accepts inputs such as the location of a proposed system and its likely performance parameters such as technologies employed, specific models and numbers of equipment to be used, and similar project specifications.\nAPI methods support analysis of project characteristics to generate estimates of economic benefits and environmental improvements. Specifications to be input include equipment, quantities, and costs as well as other relevant estimates such as natural gas prices, electric service rates, weather data source, and financing details. The API generates summaries of system cost and financial performance, expected utility bills and system cash flow, and power load along with reduction in emissions from conventional electricity generation."], "Url": ["http://www.cleanpower.com/products/powerclerk/powerclerk-api/"], "Category": ["Weather", "Energy", "Environment"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["http://www.cleanpower.com/products/powerclerk/powerclerk-api/"], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": [], "Support SSL": [], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
