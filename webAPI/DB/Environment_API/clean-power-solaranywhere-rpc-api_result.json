{"API name": ["Clean Power SolarAnywhere RPC API"], "Description": [" The service provides accumulated data about solar energy potential and weather relevant to solar energy production for specified locations. It helps to estimate the effectiveness of solar power installations, including photovoltaic (PV) technologies. A PVSimulator function provides analysis of aggregated data to project likely behavior of a PV system installed at a specified location. Data provide hourly readings recorded by weather satellites.\nAPI methods support submission of a location specified as latitude and longitude to retrieve measures of solar irradiance, measured as direct normal irradiance (DNI), global horizontal irradiance (GHI), and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DIF). Related data provide measures of weather conditions such as cloud cover, precipitation, and temperature that can also affect solar power production."], "Url": ["http://www.cleanpower.com/products/solaranywhere/solaranywhere-api/"], "Category": ["Weather", "Solar", "Energy", "Environment"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["http://www.cleanpower.com/products/solaranywhere/solaranywhere-api/"], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": [], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
