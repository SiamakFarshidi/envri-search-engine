{"API name": ["Shadow RPC API"], "Description": [" The service provides estimates of reduction of efficiency of solar energy installations due to shadows cast by terrain and other objects at a location. Estimates are based on data collected during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which created highly detailed images of surface topography. For a specified location, the service can project interference with solar irradiance by naturally occurring and constructed terrain features.\nAPI methods support submission of a location's coordinates to receive an estimate of the relief shadow effect on solar resources there. Shadow effect is stated as a percentage of the day that solar irradiance will be blocked. Methods also provide esimates of global horizontal irradiance and direct normal irradiance under clear-sky conditions."], "Url": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/w3c-web-services/shadow-w3c"], "Category": ["Weather", "Energy", "Environment", "Solar"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/w3c-web-services/shadow-w3c"], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": [], "Support SSL": [], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
