{"API name": ["SOLEMI RPC API"], "Description": [" The Solar Energy Mining (SOLEMI) service provides measures of solar energy available at locations across Europe and Africa, along with selected parts of Asia, Australia, and South America. Measures of solar irradiance data are derived from images taken by Meteosat satellites over the period 1991-2005 for locations in Europe and Africa and 1999-2006 for Asian locations. Measures are available for hourly increments with a spatial resolution of 2.5 km.\nAPI methods support submission of a location and date range for which irradiance measures are desired. The API returns measures for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct at normal incidence (DNI)."], "Url": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/w3c-web-services/solemi-w3c"], "Category": ["Weather", "Energy", "Environment"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/w3c-web-services/solemi-w3c"], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": [], "Support SSL": [], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
