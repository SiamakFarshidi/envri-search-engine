{"API name": ["EMP Climate RPC API"], "Description": [" The service provides measures of solar energy available at specified locations on the earth's surface. Data give monthly mean values of solar irradiance measures for locations around the globe. Data reflect satellite observations and meteorological observations and analyses from U.S. government agencies, the National Center for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). Separate observations are rationalized by data fusion techniques.\nAPI methods support submission of a global location as latitude, longitude, and elevation. The API returns solar energy measures such as downwelling shortwave irradiance along with low, high, and average readings for air temperature and relative humidity."], "Url": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/w3c-web-services/emp-climate-w3c"], "Category": ["Weather", "Energy", "Environment", "Solar"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/w3c-web-services/emp-climate-w3c"], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": [], "Support SSL": [], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
