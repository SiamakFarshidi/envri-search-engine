{"API name": ["EnergyIQ RPC API"], "Description": [" The service is part of efforts by the U.S. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to encourage benchmarking of building energy efficiency, with clear guidelines for actions to reduce waste and improve energy performance. It is intended both to process data in a way that supports decision-making and to provide access to raw data for an application's own processing.\nAPI methods support direct retrieval of complete datasets as well as querying data for specific building types, sizes, locations, ages, and activities housed (e.g., education, health care, retail, general office, etc.). Requests can specify energy profile details of interest, units of measurement, and chart types for output data."], "Url": ["http://energyiq.lbl.gov/EnergyIQ/SupportPages/EIQ-webservice.html"], "Category": ["Real Estate", "Energy", "Environment"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": [], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": ["http://ws.lbl.gov:8080/axis2/services/DirSvcWS/energyIQPlotInfo"], "Support SSL": ["No"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
