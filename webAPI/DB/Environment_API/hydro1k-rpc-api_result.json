{"API name": ["Hydro1K RPC API"], "Description": [" The service provides a digital model of terrain elevation and slope based on a database of terrain features compiled by the EU-funded MESoR project. Elevation and slope affect the efficiency of solar energy collection and electricity generation via photovoltaic (PV) power plants. In addition to the data service, a mapping function allows for interactive consideration of sites for solar power plants.\nAPI methods support designation of an area of interest as a mapped bounding box or specific location. Returned data provide mapping data to represent elevation, slope, and other topological features."], "Url": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/w3c-web-services/hydro1k-w3c"], "Category": ["Weather", "Energy", "Environment", "Solar"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/w3c-web-services/hydro1k-w3c"], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": [], "Support SSL": [], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
