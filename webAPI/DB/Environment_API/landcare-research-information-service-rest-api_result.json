{"API name": ["Landcare Research Information Service REST API"], "Description": [" The service provides a map-based interface to access data about environmental conditions in New Zealand. The provider maintains a repository of scientific datasets reporting measures of water and air quality, pollution, biosphere health, and other environmental conditions, and the service employs the Koordinates format to make the data available in a machine-processable interface with geolocation and mapping coordinates.\nIt supports direct queries to retrieve data directly along with mapping and spatial analyses via geographic information systems (GIS).\nAPI methods support Web Feature Service (OGC WFS) protocols to create vector layers for import into GIS and other mapping applications. Methods also integrate with other New Zealand mapping functions providing topographic data, forestation and land-cover data, and other conditions."], "Url": ["https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/p/api-support-wfs/"], "Category": ["Mapping", "Environment"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/p/api-support-wfs/"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["http://wfs.lris.scinfo.org.nz/{YOUR-WEB-SERVICE-KEY}/wfs"], "Support SSL": ["No"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
