{"API name": ["Clean Power Research Irradiance and Weather Data REST API v2.0"], "Description": [" The Clean Power Research Irradiance and Weather Data API allows users to request irradiance (the rate at which solar energy falls onto a surface) and weather data. The WeatherData endpoint returns available data such as Global Horizontal Irradiance, Direct Normal Irradiance, Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance, 10-Meter Height Wind Speed and many others. This API supports HTTP GET and POST with XML data and access that requires the utilization of Basic Authentication via username and password, and requests also need the use of HTTPS. Clean Power Research builds services for energy calculation, simulation, and automation."], "Url": ["https://developers.cleanpower.com/irradiance-and-weather-data"], "Category": ["Weather", "Data", "Energy", "Environment", "Solar"], "Provider": ["Clean Power Research"], "ServiceType": ["Web/Internet"], "Documentation": ["https://developers.cleanpower.com/irradiance-and-weather-data/rest-basics"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["https://service.solaranywhere.com/api/v2"], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
