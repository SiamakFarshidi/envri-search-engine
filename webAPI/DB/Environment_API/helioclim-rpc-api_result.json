{"API name": ["HelioClim RPC API"], "Description": [" The service provides estimates of solar energy potential for sites in Africa, the region surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, and the central part of the Atlantic Ocean. It refers to a database of solar radiation estimates based on images taken over a 20-year period by the Meteosat satellites. In addition to estimates of solar energy production, the data may provide useful input for climate studies.\nAPI methods support submission of location coordinates to retrieve estimated values for solar irradiance there. Each request can specify either a single geographic point or multiple points. Separate services are available for the period 1985-2005 and 2004-2005."], "Url": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/ogc-web-services/helioclim3-ogc-wp\u2026"], "Category": ["Weather", "Energy", "Environment"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["http://www.webservice-energy.org/web-services/ogc-web-services/helioclim3-ogc-wps"], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": [], "Support SSL": [], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
