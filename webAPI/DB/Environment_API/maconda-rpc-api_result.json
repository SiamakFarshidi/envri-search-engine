{"API name": ["MaConDa RPC API"], "Description": [" The service provides access to the Mass spectrometry Contaminant Database which aggregates research reports for chemical composition of environmental contaminant molecules. It gathers data from experimental results and theoretical projections developed both by researchers in the field and instrument providers in testing their mass spectrometers. Contaminant records are annotated with metadata describing compounds.\nAPI methods support search against the database of approximately 300 records, specifying contaminant type and ion structure of detected molecules, as well as type and specific model of mass spectrometry instruments performing the analysis."], "Url": ["http://www.maconda.bham.ac.uk/api.php"], "Category": ["Science", "Environment"], "Provider": [], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": [], "Architectural Style": ["RPC"], "Endpoint Url": [], "Support SSL": ["No"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
