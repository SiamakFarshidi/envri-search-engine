{"API name": ["Beagle Sense REST API"], "Description": [" Beagle is a range of wireless sensors that you can place throughout your home or office. Each sensor monitors either air quality, temperature, outdoor noise, indoor noise, air pressure, humidity, or light. Use the Beagle Sense API to access each sensor its data. The API uses GET methods over HTTPS with responses in JSON. Collected data is transmitted over a private wireless network to a local base station where it is securely communicated to Beagle's Cloud Service. A few of the available API methods allow you to return a list of all devices, retrieve raw data from all sensors, or configure your sensor."], "Url": ["https://github.com/BeagleSense/beaglesense-api"], "Category": ["Internet of Things", "Energy", "Environment", "Health", "Home Automation"], "Provider": ["Beagle Sense"], "ServiceType": [], "Documentation": ["https://github.com/BeagleSense/beaglesense-api"], "Architectural Style": ["REST"], "Endpoint Url": ["https://api.beaglesense.com"], "Support SSL": ["Yes"], "Logo": ["https://www.programmableweb.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif"]}
